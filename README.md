This is a collection of projects I'm pursuing in order to apply what I'm learning in mathematics and statistics courses to the concepts I'm learning in Finance courses.
While probably not very technically advanced (yet!), I'm constantly working to improve runtimes, algorithms used and apply the newest models.
